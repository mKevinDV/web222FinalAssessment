    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Kevin, and I am currently a student in the second term of the Computer Programming
      & Analysis program at Seneca College. I previously studied Chemistry at York University and
      currently work as a Night Auditor at Fairmont Royal York. Working with spreadsheets in this
      role is what sparked my interest in programming because I find that Excel works much like its
      own programming language.

      <h3>Why Egyptian Ratscrew</h3>
      <p>
        My competitive nature drew me into this game. I like games that require fast thinking, which
        explains why I love playing volleyball as a libero and playing FPS video games that demand
        fast reaction times. I grew up playing with a childhood friend, and most of the time, it
        would just be us 2. That meant there was only 1 winner and 1 loser. Neither of us would win
        more than 3 games in a row, going back and forth in wins and losses. We would always rub the
        loss in the other person's face but losing always fueled me to try harder the next game.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've learned to translate that fuel I get from losing to other aspects of my life - even
        when I fail, I can push myself to be even better and to overcome any obstacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        This game is extremely simple to set up yet requires a lot of my attention. Without a doubt,
        it is in my top 5 favourite non-electronic games to play.
