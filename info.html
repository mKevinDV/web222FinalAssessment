    <h3>History Of The Game</h3>
    <p>
      Although the origin of the game is unknown, there are different proposed theories surrounding
      the game's roots. The prevailing theory is that is that it is a combination of
      Beggar-My-Neighbour, a game known as early as the 1900s, and Slapjack, and infamous
      card-slapping game. Egyptian Ratscrew gained popularity in the 1990s.

      <h3>How To Play</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Number Of Players:</strong> 2+</li>
        <li><strong>What You Need: </strong> Deck of 52 cards</li>
        <li><strong>Objective Of The Game: </strong>To be the last player with all 52 cards</li>
        <li>
          <strong>To Start: </strong>Cards are evenly dealed, one at a time, face down to each
          player. Each player will hold their deck of cards dealed with them face down in their
          hand.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        Starting to the left of the dealer, each player will take turns making a play by removing
        the top card of the top of their deck and place it face up in the middle to create a new
        discard pile. When taking the top card from their own deck, they must flip the card
        <strong>away</strong> from them so that the card is revealed to everyone at the same time.
        Play proceeds to the next player with them playing their card on the top of the discard pile
        in a circle (clockwise) until a face card (Jack, Queen, King or Ace) is played.
        <ul>
          <p>
            If a player plays a jack, queen, king or ace, the next player in the rotation must do
            the following:
          </p>
          <li>
            If an <strong>ace</strong> is played, the next player has 4 chances to play a face card
            of their own
          </li>
          <li>
            If a <strong>king</strong> is played, the next player has 3 chances to play a face card
            of their own
          </li>
          <li>
            If a <strong>queen</strong> is played, the next player has 2 chances to play a face card
            of their own
          </li>
          <li>
            If a <strong>jack</strong> is played, the next player has 1 chance to play a face card
            of their own
          </li>
        </ul>
        If the next player does not play a face card within their allotted chances, then the last
        player who played a face card will receive the entire discard pile.
        <p>
          For example, if Player 1 plays a <strong>queen</strong>, Player 2 has
          <strong>3 chances</strong> to play a face card. If Player 2 plays a
          <strong>jack</strong> on their second chance, then Player 3 has
          <strong>1 chance</strong> to play a face card. If Player 3 plays a <strong>3</strong>,
          then Player 2 takes the entire discard pile. Player 2 will place the entire discard pile
          face-down and place it under their deck of cards in their hand. Player 2 will then play
          the top card from their deck of cards and place the card face up in the middle. The next
          player will then play their card and play will continue clockwise.
        </p>
        <strong
          >Once a player obtains all 52 cards, the game is over and they are declared the
          winner.</strong

        <p>
          Now this is what makes Egyptian Ratscrew even more fun: in addition to this basic
          turn-based system, there are other ways to retrieve the discard pile and build up the
          amount of cards in your hand. These are called slap rules. If any conditions for a slap
          rule are present, any player can slap the middle discard pile. The first player to slap
          the deck of cards in the middle retrieves the discard pile and places it on the bottom of
          their own deck and play will continue.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>
            There are many variations of the game that people play with, so the slap rules are
            created and agreed upon by all players prior to starting the game. There are the most
            standard slap rules that many players around the world play with:
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>Double:</strong> when two of the same cards are laid down consecutively (e.g.,
            10, 10)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sandwich:</strong> when two cards of the same cards are played with 1 card in
            between them (e.g., 10, 3, 10)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Top Bottom:</strong> when the first card played (at the bottom of the discard
            pile) is the same as the last card played (at the top of the discard pile) (e.g., 10, 3,
            4, 7, 10)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tens:</strong> when two cards played consecutively add up to 10. An Ace would
            count as 1, but the other face cards (Jack, Queen, King) do not have value (e.g., 10, 2
            OR A, 9)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Four In A Row:</strong> when four cards are played that are in ascending or
            descending order (e.g., 4, 5, 6, 7 OR 10, 9 8, 7)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marriage:</strong> when a Queen is played before or after a King (e.g., Q, K OR
            K, Q)
          </li>
        </ul>
        If a pile is slapped but no conditions for a slap rule are present, then the person(s) who
        incorrectly slapped must add two cards from the bottom of their pile to the bottom of the
        discard pile. If you run out of cards, you can “slap your way back in” if any of the slap
        rule conditions are met. BUT if you slap when a slap rule condition is not met, then you can
        not re-enter the current game.

      <h3>Tips & Tricks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lightning Quick Reflexes:</strong> Even If you can't get lucky and play a face
          card every turn, then being super attentive to the slap rule conditions and slapping first
          will quickly build up the deck in your hand. They happen a lot more frequently than you
          think, so always be ready to slap!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Elite Memorization:</strong> Remembering the first card played in the discard pile
          will help prepare you to slap more quickly once the same card is played. It is also good
          to try and keep track of which players have which face cards and being more attentive to
          their play to keep them from winning. The more face cards a player has, the more likely
          they are to win.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fierce Competitiveness:</strong> Without a drive to win, you might as well play Go
          Fish! You must always be ready to slap the discard pile! You can't just win on luck alone.
          You need to want it more than the other competitors! Nothing makes the game more exciting
          than every player having a competitive spirit.
